# Cognizant-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository showcases a comprehensive job simulation completed in November 2023 for Cognizant's Data Science team, focusing on artificial intelligence applications. The simulation involved conducting exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for Gala Groceries, a technology-led client of Cognizant. A Python module was prepared within this repository, containing code to train a machine learning model and provide performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team. The findings and analysis were effectively communicated through a PowerPoint presentation to convey results back to the business. 

Key skills demonstrated include communication, data analysis, data modeling, data visualization, development, evaluation, machine learning, model interpretation, problem statement formulation, Python programming, and quality assurance. 


#Task One

Gala Groceries, a technology-driven grocery chain based in the USA, prides itself on offering top-quality, locally sourced produce while facing challenges in maintaining consistent stock levels throughout the year. To address a supply chain issue, they sought assistance from Cognizant. The challenge lies in optimizing stock levels to minimize wastage without risking customer satisfaction. This business problem necessitates thorough data analysis to formulate actionable recommendations. Once the analysis is complete, a summary of findings and suggestions for further actions will be provided to the Data Science team leader for review before sharing with the client.
