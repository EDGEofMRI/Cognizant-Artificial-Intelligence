# Cognizant-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository showcases a comprehensive job simulation completed in November 2023 for Cognizant's Data Science team, focusing on artificial intelligence applications. The simulation involved conducting exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for Gala Groceries, a technology-led client of Cognizant. A Python module was prepared within this repository, containing code to train a machine learning model and provide performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team. The findings and analysis were effectively communicated through a PowerPoint presentation to convey results back to the business. 

Key skills demonstrated include communication, data analysis, data modeling, data visualization, development, evaluation, machine learning, model interpretation, problem statement formulation, Python programming, and quality assurance. 


#Task One

Gala Groceries, a technology-driven grocery chain based in the USA, prides itself on offering top-quality, locally sourced produce while facing challenges in maintaining consistent stock levels throughout the year. To address a supply chain issue, they sought assistance from Cognizant. The challenge lies in optimizing stock levels to minimize wastage without risking customer satisfaction. This business problem necessitates thorough data analysis to formulate actionable recommendations. Once the analysis is complete, a summary of findings and suggestions for further actions will be provided to the Data Science team leader for review before sharing with the client.

#Task Two

The client has refined the problem statement to focus on predicting stock levels accurately using sales and sensor data on an hourly basis, aiming to optimize procurement processes. They have agreed to provide sensor data measuring temperature in storage facilities and stock levels in refrigerators and freezers. Your task is to review the provided data model diagram by the Data Engineering team, select relevant data sources, and devise a strategic plan for addressing the problem statement. Your plan will be summarized concisely in a PowerPoint presentation for review by the Data Science team leader and the client, ensuring it is business-friendly and comprehensive within a single slide.

#Task Three

This task involves leveraging machine learning techniques to address the business problem by combining, transforming, and modeling three provided datasets. Once the modeling process is finalized, it is crucial to effectively communicate your work and analysis in a single PowerPoint slide, ensuring the use of business-friendly language. The slide should succinctly present the results in a manner understandable to the business stakeholders, avoiding technical metrics and instead providing relevant insights in easily interpretable terms.

#Task Four

As the Data Scientist responsible for creating the promising machine learning model for Gala Groceries, the task is to prepare a Python module that can be easily integrated into production. Currently housed in a Python notebook, the model needs to be transformed into a production-ready format. Your role involves developing a Python module that includes code for training the model and outputting performance metrics when executed, laying the groundwork for seamless integration and ongoing monitoring of the algorithm's performance.

#Task Five

Before deploying the algorithm into production, the ML engineering team has conducted tests by comparing predictions generated by the algorithm with actual results for 'estimated_stock_pct'. These tests aimed to evaluate the algorithm's performance on live data. Now, the ML engineering team seeks to discuss with you some questions regarding the algorithm to enhance its effectiveness further. This discussion is crucial for refining the model before integration with Gala Groceries' live system by the DevOps team.
