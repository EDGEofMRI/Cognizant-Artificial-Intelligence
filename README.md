# Cognizant-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository showcases a comprehensive job simulation completed in November 2023 for Cognizant's Data Science team, focusing on artificial intelligence applications. The simulation involved conducting exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for Gala Groceries, a technology-led client of Cognizant. A Python module was prepared within this repository, containing code to train a machine learning model and provide performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team. The findings and analysis were effectively communicated through a PowerPoint presentation to convey results back to the business. 

Key skills demonstrated include communication, data analysis, data modeling, data visualization, development, evaluation, machine learning, model interpretation, problem statement formulation, Python programming, and quality assurance.
